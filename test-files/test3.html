    <h1>Test 3: Footer get down!</h1>
    <p>Now we're going to make the footer stick to the bottom of the site no matter how tall the page is. When an HTML page contains a small amount of content, the footer can sometimes sit halfway up the page leaving a blank space underneath, and this can look bad on a big screen.</p>
    <p>Because you have the structure of the page now and you'll need to be making these changes in the style.css stylesheet (which is referenced on all the pages) you shouldn't need to do any copying and pasting across each page with this. Yay!</p>
    <ol>
      <li>We already have the six main elements on the page we need to make this work: <code>html</code>, <code>body</code>, <code>div</code> with an ID of container, <code>header</code>, <code>main</code> and <code>footer</code> so you shouldn't need to touch the HTML files here.</li>
      <li>This is something that you might get asked to do on sites that don't have masses of content, so it's useful to know. A lot of sites are extremely long and require lots of scrolling so for those you won't need to do this, but it's good to know the technique is out there if you need it. ANYWAY</li>
      <li>Using <a href="https://matthewjamestaylor.com/bottom-footer" target="_blank">this fabulous guide from 2007 (written by someone called Matthew James Taylor - friend of yours?)</a> apply the correct styling to our elements to keep our footer at the bottom of the screen. We're both using divs with an ID of container, but he's used IDs to target the elements inside his container div, whereas we're using html5 elements so remember when he has <code>div id="header"</code> - that's our <code>header</code> element, his <code>div id="body"</code> is our <code>main</code> element etc.</li>
      <li>Yeah, so if you can look at how he's done it and apply his styles to our elements to keep that footer DOWN without changing any of our HTML you're onto a winner. I can never remember how to do this and google 'footer get down' literally every time to find this article, so it's useful to have in your arsenal. Bon chance!</li>
