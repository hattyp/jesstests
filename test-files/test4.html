    <h1>Test 3: Branching and page content</h1>
    <p>For our next trick, we're gonna delve a bit deeper into using Git because it can do all sorts. And we'll add a bit of code too so we can experiment with the new Git stuff.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>BRANCHING: We're gonna use SourceTree a bit more here, so let's open that badboy up. Branching is something you'll need to do on any project where there's more than one person working on it, and there are two of us working on this! so it's good to know AND worthwhile us using it.</li>
      <li>Currently we're on the <code>master</code> branch. You can see this because in SourceTree under the BRANCHES list on the left hand side of the page the name <code>master</code> has the circle next to it. If you click 'Fetch' at the top of the SourceTree screen this should update your local version of the project so it's inline with the 'origin' version (i.e. the version that's online in the cloud) and you should see a new branch appear in the BRANCHES list called <code>develop</code>. This is a branch i've created and pushed up to 'origin'. Double click on this guy to change branches. You'll be able to see you've changed branches successfully because the circle will now be next to <code>develop</code> - if a box comes up asking if you want to discard your local changes just click ok</li>
      <li>'develop' is quite a common branch name that gets used a lot in bigger projects, it's nice to have a 'master' branch where all the live code is, a 'develop' branch for people to work off and test on, and 'feature' branches for building new features. <a href="https://williamdurand.fr/images/bm002.png" target="_blank">Here's</a> a nice diagram I found showing a develop and a master branch living snugly side by side with nice little blobs to show individual commits and nice arrows to show merging them together.
      </li>
      <li>When you create a new branch it branches off the branch you're currently on, so as I created 'develop' while I was on 'master' and haven't made any changes, these two branches are exactly the same. Now you're going to create a new branch off develop to work on for this next bit.</li>
