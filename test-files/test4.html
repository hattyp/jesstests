    <h1>Test 4: Branching and page content</h1>
    <p>For our next trick, we're gonna delve a bit deeper into using Git because it can do all sorts. And we'll add a bit of code too so we can experiment with the new Git stuff.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>BRANCHING: We're gonna use SourceTree a bit more here, so let's open that badboy up. Branching is something you'll need to do on any project where there's more than one person working on it, and there are two of us working on this! so it's good to know AND worthwhile us using it.</li>
      <li>Currently we're on the <code>master</code> branch. You can see this because in SourceTree under the BRANCHES list on the left hand side of the page the name <code>master</code> has the circle next to it. If you click 'Fetch' at the top of the SourceTree screen this should update your local version of the project so it's inline with the 'origin' version (i.e. the version that's online in the cloud) and you should see a new branch appear in the BRANCHES list called <code>develop</code>. This is a branch i've created and pushed up to 'origin'. Double click on <code>develop</code> to change over onto the <code>develop</code> branch, refresh this page, and your next instructions will be on this same page, but on that branch. You'll be able to see you've changed branches successfully because in SourceTree the circle will now be next to <code>develop</code> under the BRANCHES list.</li>
    </ol>
